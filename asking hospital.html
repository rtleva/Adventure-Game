<title> Asking the hospital </title>
<h1> You have to be careful... </h1>
<p> There was lots of empty hospital beds. You were worried there was no one let which was weird since it was a hospital. Finally you see a man with arrow in his head in on of the hospital beds. You go up to him and ask how he got hurt. But he couldn't talk. </p>
